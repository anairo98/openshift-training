# Welcome to the world of Kubernetes

This guide is designed to help you get started with Red Hat OpenShift. Whether you're new to OpenShift or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this training will provide you with the basic concepts and hands-on experience needed to start to utilize Kubernetes effectively.

## Workshop Structure
This workshop will start at the very beginning with very simple hands-on sessions and then build up step by step. At the end, participants should be able to get to grips with OpenShift.

## Prerequisites
Participants must have access to an Openshift cluster to carry out the hands-on tasks. Ideally, each participant uses their own namespace and can try out and test all exercises and tasks in it.

## Hands-On Labs
For the Hands-On Tasks thery will be a usecase provided. In the usecase, a simple web app is set up step by step as part of an online boutique store. The entire online store is made up of individual microservices.

The microservices have to be connected to each other and made accessible with routes and services (everything else is covered in the specific tasks). The idea of the online boutique store is based on the GoogleCloudPlatform repository
